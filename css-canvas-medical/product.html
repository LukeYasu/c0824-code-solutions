                Canvas creates a shared understanding for patient care across
                clinicians, staff, and parents themselves –– making you more
                productive, less stressed, and adding just a bit more joy into
                your practice of medicine.

                Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your note, so you
                never have to leave it. And because Canvas learns from every
                interaction, It gets smarter with every patient you see.

                &quot;Canvas works three times as fast, improves performance
                dramatically on key quality metrics, and is incredibly easy to

                right time, and the projects leverages technology to actually
                improve the quality of care I provide.&quot;

                Canvas made it simple to search and take action across your
                entire patient panel, so you know who needs extra help and how
                best to give it to them. Easily reach out to any subgroup of
                your population with proactive interventions, and take comfort
                knowing you're a step ahead.

              <h1>It automates performance improvement</h1>
              <p>
                Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you
                understand performance, but they aren't enough to improve
                quality and increase revenue day after day. Canvas automates
                quality protocols and charge capture so clinicians can focus on
                more complex work only they can do.

                &quot;With MIPS a reality and fee-for-service billing rules as
                complex as ever, to be honest I didn't know how we were going to
                keep up. We're a small practice and we don't have a big quality
                team or a group of coders to catch everything. The automation in
