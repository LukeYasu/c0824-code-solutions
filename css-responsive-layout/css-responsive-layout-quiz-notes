## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
  a breakpoint is the width where when you are in that width, you want to apply certain properties, often changing width of elements
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
  because it will use 50% of the space always and if you were to use px, if the column becomes less than the px value then it no longer takes up that px width
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
  it takes the most recent ruleset and because the min-width below is smaller than the one above, it will always meet the smaller condition if the top one is met
