## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  the purpose of a loop is to go over the same code until a certain condition is met
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  it lets us know what condition needs to be met for the loop to stop looping.
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  in loops iterations mean it goes over something and executes the code if it meets the conditionals. you can iterate over an array and every element in that array can be ran through the code using iteration.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  at the start or top of the loop
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  at the start of the loop as it is the first thing in the parenthesis of a loop
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  second after the initialization expression
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  third after the condition returns true. if it returns false,the loop is finished.
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  break
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  it acts as a += 1 as it increments 1 to the variable to its left
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  you use a for in loop and the variable after the for keyword should be assigned the key
