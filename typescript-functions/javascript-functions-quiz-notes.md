## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  a function is something that takes in parameters and returns a return value or performs some sort of operation
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  you first have to define it with the 'function' key word and then the function name, parameters, and operations
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  you call by the function name and then add inputs into the brackets where the parameters go
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  the function definition has all of the work that is carried out and the function call has the information needed to execute the function
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  a parameter is a placeholder for where the arguments will eventually go and the argument is an actual value that can be changed and returned
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  It is useful so that we can have a set datatype that can do a specific task in the function
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  return is what gives out the result of the expression within the function that used the parameter. It also stops the function when it reaches the return statement
- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  a variable being assigned to parameters with an arrow pointing to the expression
- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  you do not need to include the return statement.
